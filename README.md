# SMB World 1-1
This project is a basic recreation of the 1st level from the NES Super Mario Bros game. This project was meant to help me learn to use HTML5 canvas.

## Controls
* Use arrow keys to move (Use `Up Arrow` to jump).  
* Press `X` to use the Fireflower.  
* Hit `Enter` to pause the game.

## Disclaimer
I do not own any of the assets used in this project.  
All sprites were obtained from https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros/.
